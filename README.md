Parametric sweeping in simulink &amp; PSpice co-simulation by programming in matlab

Welcome to Simulink & PSpice co-simulation!

Here we are going to sweep parameters in circuits programmatically.

Basically, the prarameters are modified by writing to the .JSON file,which is created automatically when you link you PSpice simulations file to MATLAB simulink through PSpice Systems interface.

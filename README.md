Parametric sweeping in simulink &amp; PSpice co-simulation by programming in matlab

Welcome to Simulink & PSpice co-simulation!

Here we are going to sweep parameters in circuits programmatically.

Basically, the prarameters are modified by writing to the .JSON file,which is created automatically when you link you PSpice simulations file to MATLAB simulink through PSpice Systems interface.

Here is an example of a RC circuit excited by a square wave.
Please refer to the initialization file for the scripts which is used to modify the .JSON file.

Have fun with it! Make your simulation run without your engaging.
